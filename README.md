# Actors3RocketScienceSnakeGame
Snake for actors 3( https://github.com/PixeyeHQ/actors.unity ). It has no analogues! Because no one has made the snake exactly the way I did it. (Do not write a snake either, or write, but remember, the goal of this project was not to solve the task of "creating a snake game", but to test actors3 for strength)
